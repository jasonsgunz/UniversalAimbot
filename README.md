Where this Script works:

100% Sure it works: Games with no custom Hitbox neither anti cheat.

Where it partially works: Games with weird anti cheat example: da hood (vizualizer might not work since i didnt find a universal fix yet)

Games where it wont/might work: games with custom hitboxes and really good anti cheat. (NOTE: Not every good anti cheat can detect my script so it might work)
